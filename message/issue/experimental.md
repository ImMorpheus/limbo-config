Hey @${author}! You seem to be running an experimental version (${version}) of ${repository_name} that should not be run on production systems.

Plugin compatibility **will** break often on experimental systems, so unless you are a plugin developer assisting the next version of the API, please reproduce on the reccomended build or latest build of Sponge (${stable}).
